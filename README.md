# Credit-Risk-Loan-assesment
This project aims to develop a Credit Risk Assessment System that evaluates loan applications based on various risk factors. The system analyzes applicant data, including credit history, income, loan amount, and repayment behavior, to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.
🔍 Methodology
Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key trends.
Feature Engineering – Creating new variables that improve model performance.
Model Selection & Training – Training multiple models and selecting the best-performing one.
Performance Evaluation – Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
